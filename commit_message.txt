DATATABLES INTEGRATION:
- Client-side processing for < 1,000 records
- Live search without page reload
- Column sorting on click
- Custom pagination with Bootstrap Argon theme
- Bahasa Indonesia language pack
- Event delegation for dynamic rows

Employee Features:
  ✓ NIP validation (18 digits, numeric only)
  ✓ SPD count annotation (query optimization)
  ✓ Soft delete (is_active flag)
  ✓ Search by name/NIP
  ✓ AJAX modal for create/edit
  ✓ DataTables with 20 rows per page

User Features:
  ✓ Password strength validation (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special)
  ✓ Permission management (is_staff, is_superuser, groups)
  ✓ Self-modification prevention (cannot delete/deactivate own account)
  ✓ Admin reset password (no old password required)
  ✓ User self-edit profile (limited fields, existing template)
  ✓ User self-change password (old password required, existing template)
  ✓ Document & activity counts with query optimization
  ✓ Status badges (Active/Inactive, Staff, Superuser, Groups)

ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Service Layer Pattern (separation of concerns)
  * Views: HTTP layer only (thin controllers)
  * Services: Business logic (pure functions)
  * Models: Data layer
- Form Mixins Pattern (DRY principle)
- Transaction management (atomic operations)
- Query optimization (select_related, prefetch_related, annotate)
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive documentation (docstrings with examples)

SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS:
- Password hashing (Django's make_password)
- CSRF protection on all mutations
- Permission checks (@user_passes_test decorator)
- Soft delete (data preservation for audit)
- Self-modification prevention (superuser cannot delete own account)
- Transaction rollback on errors

BUG FIXES:
- DataTables badge update: Changed selector from `.badge-pill` to `.card-header .badge-pill`
  * Prevents sidebar badge corruption when DataTables updates count
  * Applies to both employee_list.html and user_list.html

CONSISTENCY:
- Reuse AjaxHandler from archive app
- Same modal pattern as document management
- Same table structure as document list
- Bootstrap Argon theme throughout
- Consistent naming conventions
- Same documentation style

DOCUMENTATION:
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Implementation notes in each file
- Maintenance notes for future developers
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Complete implementation guide with checklist
